## About the Project
#### Origins
 The Project came about due to [Linus of LTT](https://mobile.twitter.com/linusgsebastian?lang=en) complaining about the state of another polling site. As a new developer, this inspired me to make one to build my portfolio

#### Purpose
<p> This project served two purposes.1) Let me practice implementing a polling feature. I have other projects where polling will be a feature. 2) Show others doing the same a base to start withe their own poling app.</P>
